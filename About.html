          "Welcome! I'm excited to share a bit about my journey. As a software engineering student, I’ve always been fascinated by how technology bridges gaps and solves real-world problems.<br>
          My journey began with a curiosity for how things work, which quickly turned into a passion for coding and creating.<br>
          Through hands-on experiences and countless late nights experimenting with projects, I’ve built not just technical skills, but also a mindset focused on innovation and resilience.<br>
          What drives me most is the opportunity to use technology to empower communities and create solutions that truly matter.<br>
          Beyond the lines of code, I enjoy connecting with like-minded individuals, exploring new ideas, and learning from every experience. My ultimate goal? To contribute to a world where technology serves as a tool for growth, equality, and progress."
